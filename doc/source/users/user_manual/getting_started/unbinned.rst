Doing an unbinned analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As gamma-ray events are rare, the counts cubes generated by :ref:`ctbin`
will in general be sparsly populated, having many empty pixels, in
particular at high energies.
An alternative analysis technique consists of working directly on the event
list without binning the events in a counts cube. You will see the benefit of
such an analysis later once you re-run :ref:`ctlike` in unbinned mode.

For unbinned analysis you first have to define the data space region over
which the analysis is done. This is similiar to the :ref:`ctbin` step for
a binned analysis where you defined the size of the counts cube, the energy
range, and the time interval. For unbinned analysis you have no such thing 
as a counts cube, but you have to define over which region of the data space
the selected events are spread (because the ctools have to integrate over
this region to compute the total number of predicted events in the data space
that you analyse). Furthermore, you have to define what energy range is
covered, and what time interval is spanned by the data. All this is done 
by the :ref:`ctselect` tool, which replaces the :ref:`ctbin` step in an
unbinned analysis.

:ref:`ctselect` performs an event selection by choosing only events within
a given region-of-interest (ROI), within a given energy band, and within a
given time interval from the input event list. The ROI is a circular region on
the sky, for which you define the centre (in celestial coordinates) and the
radius. Such a circular ROI is sometimes also called an acceptance cone. The
following example shows how to run ctselect:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ctselect
  Input event list or observation definition XML file [events.fits] 
  RA for ROI centre (degrees) (0-360) [83.63] 
  Dec for ROI centre (degrees) (-90-90) [22.01] 
  Radius of ROI (degrees) (0-180) [3.0] 
  Start time (CTA MET in seconds) [0.0] 
  End time (CTA MET in seconds) [0.0] 
  Lower energy limit (TeV) [0.1] 
  Upper energy limit (TeV) [100.0] 
  Output event list or observation definition XML file [selected_events.fits] 

:ref:`ctselect` takes the input event list ``events.fits``, performs an
event selection, and writes the selected event into the file 
``selected_events.fits``. The parameters it will query for are the centre
of the ROI, the radius of the ROI, the start and stop time (in seconds),
and the energy lower and upper limits (in TeV). The event selection information
is also written as a set of data selection keywords to the output events
file ``selected_events.fits``, by respecting the same syntax that has been
implemented for Fermi/LAT. The following image is a screen dump of the data
selection keywords that have been written to the ``EVENTS`` header in the
file ``selected_events.fits``:

   *Data selection keywords*

**It is mandatory for an unbinned analysis that these data selection keywords
exist in the FITS file.**
If they don't exist, :ref:`ctlike` will not execute in unbinned mode.

Below some lines of the ``ctselect.log`` file that show the data selection 
part:

.. note::

   :ref:`ctobssim` will also write data selection keywords in the event
   list FITS file, hence you can run :ref:`ctlike` directly on a FITS file
   produced by :ref:`ctobssim`. Any selection performed by :ref:`ctselect`
   needs to be fully enclosed within any previous selection, e.g. the ROI
   needs to be fully enclosed in the acceptance cone used for event 
   simulation, the energy selection must be fully comprised in the
   range of simulated energies, the same applies for the temporal selection.
   :ref:`ctselect` will automatically adjust
   the selection parameters to guarantee full enclosure. To keep track of
   this adjustment, the :ref:`ctselect` log file quotes the requested
   selection, any existing selections, and the selection that was finally 
   applied.

.. note::

   :ref:`ctselect` may of course also be used for event selection prior to
   binned analysis, for example to select events for a given period in
   time. The ``WEIGHT`` extension of the counts cube will track the overlap
   between the ROI applied by :ref:`ctselect` and the counts cube, and this
   information will be transparently used in any further analysis to restrict
   the analysis on counts cube bins that contain data.

Now that you have selected the events of interest, you can run ctlike in 
unbinned mode. To do this you have to specify the selected event list 
instead of the counts cube:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ctlike 
  Input event list, counts cube or observation definition XML file [cntcube.fits] selected_events.fits
  Calibration database [prod2] 
  Instrument response function [South_0.5h] 
  Input model XML file [$CTOOLS/share/models/crab.xml]
  Output model XML file [crab_results.xml] 

You will recognise that :ref:`ctlike` runs much faster in unbinned mode
compared to binned mode.
This is understandable as the selected event list contains
only 21604 events, while the binned counts cube you used before had
200 x 200 x 20 = 800000 bins. As unbinned maximum likelihood fitting loops
over the events (while binned maximum likelihood loops over the bins),
there are much less operations to perform in unbinned than in binned mode
(there is some additional overhead in unbinned mode that comes from
integrating the models over the region of interest, yet this is negligible
compared to the operations needed when looping over all pixels). So as long
as you work with small event lists, unbinned mode is faster (this
typically holds up to 50 hours of observing time for point sources).
Unbinned :ref:`ctlike` should also be more precise as no binning is performed,
hence there is no loss of information due to histogramming.

Below you see the corresponding output from the ``ctlike.log`` file. The fitted
parameters are essentially identical to the ones found in binned mode.
The slight difference with respect to the binned analysis may be explained
by the different event sample that has been used for the analysis: while 
binned likelihood works on rectangular counts cubes, unbinned likelihood works
on circular event selection regions. It is thus not possible to select exactly
the same events for both analyses.
