First steps with ctools
-----------------------

This section provides a step-by-step description of a simple CTA data 
analysis example using the ctools. In this example we will simulate a
half an hour long CTA observation of the Crab nebula as the single
point source within the CTA field of view. You will learn how to bin the
event data into a counts cube and how to fit a spatial and spectral model
to the data. You will also learn how to analyse directly event lists 
without binning the events into a counts cube. We will show how you can
create a butterfly diagram that shows the confidence band of the
fitted spectral model. And you will learn how to take energy dispersion
into account.
