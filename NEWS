New Features and Important Changes in ctools 1.3.0.dev1

28 March 2017


Introduction
------------
This document briefly summarizes the changes that have been made in this
ctools release with respect to the precedent release.


Configuration
-------------
None


Python interface
----------------
None


Support model
-------------
The ctool::init_members() method now sets the local language to English
so that writing commas instead of dots is avoided (#1370).


ctobssim - CTA observation simulation
-------------------------------------
The tool now supports map cubes that are not overlapping with the RoI.
In this case, no spectral nodes exist and before the spectral flux()
method called in ctobssim::get_model_flux() was throwing an exception.
Now, for map cubes outside the RoI the flux is set to zero.


ctselect - CTA event selection
------------------------------
None


ctbin - CTA event binning
-------------------------
None


ctlike - Maximum likelihood fitting
-----------------------------------
None


cttsmap - Generation of Test Statistic map
------------------------------------------
None


ctskymap - CTA sky mapping
--------------------------
Any RoI is now taken into account in ctskymap so that if IRF background
subtraction is requested the counts and background maps are coherent. In
addition, the energy integration over the background template is now done
numerically so that strong variations in the background rate, such as
those occuring close to the threshold, are correctly taken into account
(#1975).


ctmodel - CTA counts cube modelling
-----------------------------------
None


ctexpcube - CTA exposure cube generation
----------------------------------------
None


ctpsfcube - CTA point spread function cube generation
-----------------------------------------------------
None


ctedispcube - CTA energy dispersion cube generation
---------------------------------------------------
None


ctbkgcube - CTA background cube generation
------------------------------------------
None


ctmapcube - CTA map cube generation
-----------------------------------
The tool now supports loading the energy binning definition from an energy
boundary FITS file, behaving now similar to the other cube tools (#1978).


ctcubemask - CTA cube filtering
-------------------------------
None


ctbutterfly - Generate butterfly diagrams
-----------------------------------------
None


ctulimit - Compute upper limit
------------------------------
None


cterror - Likelihood profile error computation
----------------------------------------------
None


cscripts
--------
The csebins script has been added that generates an energy boundaries
extension that can be used for a stacked analysis. The energy boundaries
are set as function of the variation in the effective area and background
rates of the Instrument Response Function (#1976).


Examples
--------
None


caldb
-----
None


models
